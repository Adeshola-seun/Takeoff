<div class="deathoftakeoff">
<h3>On November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot three times in the torso and head and was killed on the scene at 810 Billiards & Bowling in Houston, Texas.
 He and about 40 people gathered outside the bowling alley after a private party ended there around 1:00 a.m. CDT, according to Houston's KHOU-11 TV.Takeoff's uncle and fellow Migos member Quavo was present during the shooting but was not injured, although he reportedly fainted following the incident and was carried to a vehicle.
Takeoff had posted a video earlier in the night in which he had been driving around Houston with Jas Prince (2nd son of James Prince), who was celebrating his brother's birthday.
Houston Police Sergeant Michael Arrington stated that an altercation broke out as a large group gathered outside the venue's third-floor entrance, and at least two guns were fired.
In a statement, Takeoff's record label said that he was killed by a "stray bullet", and Houston police chief Troy Finner said that he did not believe Takeoff to be the intended target.
The Houston Police Department reported that a fatal shooting had taken place at 2:40 a.m. CDT and that the victim was found dead on arrival while two other victims were "taken in private vehicles to hospitals".
The department later added: "We are not releasing an identity of the deceased victim until his family is notified & ID verified by Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences." Houston police later confirmed that Takeoff had been killed in the shooting.
A nurse who lived near the bowling alley heard the shots and ran to the scene. She checked the rapper's pulse, but at the time of her arrival, he was already dead.
Two other people, 24-year-old Joshua "Wash" Washington (a business associate of Quavo) and a 23-year-old woman, suffered non-life-threatening injuries during the shooting.
