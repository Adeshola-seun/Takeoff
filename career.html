<h2> CAREER </h2>
<h3><strong>2008–2018: Early work with Migos </strong><br/>

<i>Along with fellow family members Quavo and Offset, Takeoff began rapping in 2008.
The group initially performed under the stage name Polo Club, but eventually changed their name to Migos.
The group released their first full-length project, a mixtape titled Juug Season, on August 25, 2011.
They followed with the mixtape No Label, on June 1, 2012.
Migos initially rose to prominence after the release of their single "Versace", in 2013.
The song was remixed by Canadian rapper Drake and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Their debut studio album, Yung Rich Nation, was released in July 2015, and featured guest appearances from Chris Brown and Young Thug, and production from Zaytoven and Murda Beatz.
The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200.
Migos achieved their first number one single in 2016 with "Bad and Boujee" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, peaking on the Billboard Hot 100 during the week of January 21, 2017.
The song has gone on to be certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
While he can be seen in one of the background scenes in the music video, Takeoff is not featured nor credited on the song.
Takeoff claimed that he was not featured on the song because he was busy at the time of recording.
During filming of Complex's Everyday Struggle at the BET Awards 2017, he was questioned about his absence by hosts Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks, to which he replied, "Do it look like I'm left off 'Bad and Boujee'?"
Takeoff's response caused Budden to leave the set, and an altercation between Migos and Budden and their entourages almost took place before it was broken up by security.
